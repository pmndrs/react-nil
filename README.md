  <a id="cover" href="#cover"><img src="img/nil.svg" alt="There are legitimate use cases for null components or logical components. A component has a lifecycle, local state, packs side-effects into useEffect, memoizes calculations in useMemo, orchestrates async ops with suspense, communicates via context, and maintains fast response with concurrency. And, of course â€” the entire React ecosystem is available." /></a>

#### Nothing to see here ...

Quite so. This package allows you to bring React's high-level component abstraction to Node or wherever you need it. Why not manage your REST endpoints like routes on the client, users as components with mount/unmount lifecycles, self-contained separation of concern, and clean side effects? Suspense for requests, etc.

You can try a small demo here: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-nil-mvpry

#### How does it work?

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'
import { render } from 'react-nil'

function Foo() {
  const [active, set] = React.useState(false)
  React.useEffect(() => void setInterval(() => set((a) => !a), 1000), [])
  console.log(active)

  // This is a logical component without a view, it renders nothing,
  // but it has a real lifecycle and is managed by React regardless.
  return null
}

render(<Foo />)
```
